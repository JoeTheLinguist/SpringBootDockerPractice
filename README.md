# SpringBootDockerPractice

## To learn containerization in preparation to containerize the application my partner and I are developing through Techno Disco, we each followed an introductory-level tutorial, [Kickstart Your Spring Boot Application Development](https://www.docker.com/blog/kickstart-your-spring-boot-application-development/).

## After successfully containerizing the Hello World Spring Boot application, we followed Docker's [9 Tips for Containerizing Your Spring Boot Code](https://www.docker.com/blog/9-tips-for-containerizing-your-spring-boot-code/) to improve upon the basic Dockerfile we had written.

## This repository is a record of that project.

## Technology Used:
* Spring Boot
* Docker CLI
* Docker Dashboard
* Snyk developer security platform
